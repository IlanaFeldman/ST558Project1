## Description

This project contains a vignette that contacts the Pokemon API that I have chosen and return well-formatted, parsed data. This vignette will be found in PokemonVignette.md. It contains the following components:

  1. A list of all required packages
  2. Functions that contact the Pokemon API and return well-formatted, parsed data.
    * There are six spots where a user may customize the returned data.
    * Inputs are flexible and easy to specify, allowing for column customization when appropriate.
  3. A basic exploratory data analysis that:
    * Takes from multiple endpoints.
    * Creates new variables from existing variables in the dataset.
    * Contains contingency tables.
    * Contains numerical summaries at each setting of at least one categorical variable.
    * Contains at least five well-formatted plots, including each of a bar plot, histogram, box plot, and scatter plot.
  4. All relevant code chunks, in particular the functions used to call the API and the commands used to obtain the data.
