This project will, hopefully, contain a vignette that contacts the Covid-19 API that I have chosen and return well-formatted, parsed data. This vignette will be found in another file, to be named. It will contain the following components:

  1. A list of all required packages
  2. Functions that contact the Covid-19 API and return well-formatted, parsed data.
    * There will be at least six spots where a user may customize the returned data.
    * Inputs will be flexible and easy to specify, for example allowing either a quoted string or its abbreviation.
  3. A basic exploratory data analysis that:
    * Takes from multiple endpoints.
    * Creates new variables from existing variables in the dataset.
    * Contains contingency tables.
    * Contains numerical summaries at each setting of at least one categorical variable.
    * Contains at least five well-formatted plots, including each of a bar plot, histogram, box plot, and scatter plot.
